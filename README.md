Narrative Vizualization project, CS 416, Yoon Lee

I'm doing a visualization of the dataset, provided by Nikhil Bhathi at Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/songseungwon/2020-udemy-courses-dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilbhathi/data-scientist-salary-us-glassdoor)

This data was pre-processed for making visualization in the following way:
- Only 3 raw files were chosen for analysis, for Tech, Business and Finance domains.
- Those 3 files were processed by Python script, which calculated the number of courses in each domain for a certain “stars” value. 
- As I have processed files by the script separately, I have combined the result further in Excel to have the single file with columns “Stars”, “Tech”, “Business”, “Finance”, where “Stars” depicted the number of stars for this row, and the other 3 columns showed the courses count for the respective domain. Data file was stored as “stars_overall.csv”.


Visualization works best in Chrome browser.
